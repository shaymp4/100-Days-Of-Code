# 100 Days of Code – Shay's Dev Adventure

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code** journey!

I’m Shay — a software engineering student, a new dad, and someone levelling up every day through code. This repository will track everything I build, break, fix, and learn from.

## Why I'm Doing This

I want to:
- Build strong habits through daily coding
- Learn through real practice, not just theory
- Document my growth and challenges
- Make small but steady progress that stacks over time

---

## Topics I’ll Explore

- 🐍 Python fundamentals & mini projects  
- 🌐 HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics  
- 🔥 Challenges from Enki, The Odin Project, etc.

## 🗂 Repo Structure

Each folder = a new day. 
Inside, I’ll include:
- 📄 Code files
- 📝 A short breakdown of what I learned
- 🖼️ Screenshots or visuals (when relevant)
