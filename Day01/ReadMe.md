# ðŸ“… Day 1 â€“ Python Practice: Number Analyzer & Basic Calculator

To kick off my 100 Days of Code journey, I built two beginner-friendly Python command-line tools that helped me practice core programming concepts.

---

## 1. Number Analyzer

This tool analyzes a number and reports:

- Whether it's **positive or negative**
- Whether it's **even or odd**

### What I Practiced:
- Using `if`, `else`, and `elif` conditionals
- Writing clear, purpose-specific functions
- Returning formatted string output

**File**: `number_analyzer.py`

---

## 2. Basic Calculator

A simple Python calculator that performs:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division (with error handling for division by zero)

### What I Practiced:
- Function creation for math operations
- Handling user-defined inputs
- Basic arithmetic logic
- Preventing runtime errors using conditionals

**File**: `basic_calculator.py`

---

## Summary

These two projects helped reinforce:
- Modular code design
- Basic arithmetic logic and flow control
- Thinking in terms of reusable code blocks (functions)
- Building output that is clean and understandable

**Next goal** â†’ Make the calculator into a fully interactive CLI tool with a menu and input prompts.
