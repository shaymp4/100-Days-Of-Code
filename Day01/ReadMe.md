# 100 Days of Code â€“ Day 1

## What I Built
Today I created two beginner-friendly Python CLI tools:
1. **Number Analyser** â€“ determines whether a number is positive/negative and even/odd.
2. **Basic Calculator** â€“ performs add, subtract, multiply, divide operations with input validation.

## These projects helped me solidify my understanding of:
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Functions and modular code
- String formatting
- Error handling (e.g., division by zero)

## Next Steps
	â€¢	Turn these into interactive CLI tools that take input from users
	â€¢	Add support for more number checks like prime, square, or divisible by
	â€¢	Create a simple menu interface using loops
