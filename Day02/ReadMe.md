# üìÖ Day 2 ‚Äì Python Practice: Pok√©mon Trainer & Calculator CLI

On Day 2 of my 100 Days of Code journey, I worked on two beginner-friendly Python projects to strengthen my understanding of:

- Tuples and data unpacking
- Functions and modular design
- User input and conditionals
- Looping and CLI interaction

---

## 1. Pok√©mon Trainer Tuple Project

I created a mini trainer profile using a tuple to store a Pok√©mon‚Äôs name, trainer name, and badge count.

### Features:
- Tuple unpacking into variables
- `trainerProfile()` function to print data
- `pokeSearch()` to look up Pok√©mon by name
- A fun `battle()` function that randomly selects an enemy and awards a badge if the player wins

### What I Practiced:
- Working with tuples
- Writing functions with return values
- Using `random.choice()` to simulate encounters
- Simple game logic

**File**: `pokemon_tuple.py`

## 2. Interactive Calculator CLI

Built a terminal-based calculator with a clean, menu-driven interface. Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Improving upon my calculator from day 1.

### Features:
- Loop-based menu (`while True`) for continuous interaction
- `try` / `except` error handling for input validation
- Mathematical functions for each operation
- Division by zero protection

### What I Practiced:
- Function creation and reuse
- Menu control with `if-elif` structure
- Input parsing and validation
- Modular design using custom functions

**File**: `calculator_menu.py`

## Summary

Both of these projects helped me build confidence with:

- Structuring simple Python programs
- Using inputs, loops, and functions together
- Keeping code readable and interactive
- Taking creative ideas (like Pok√©mon!) and applying programming logic to them

---

**Next goal** ‚Üí Expand the Pok√©mon project into a full battle system with health stats and multiple Pok√©mon using dictionaries or classes.
