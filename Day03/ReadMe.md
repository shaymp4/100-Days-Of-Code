# 📅 Day 3 – Exploring Generative AI with Enki

Today I explored the **Enki Generative AI Skills** course. The session focused on how generative AI works, key terminology, and prompt engineering techniques.

## Key Concepts Learned

### What is Generative AI?
- AI that creates new content such as **text**, **images**, **code**, and **data**
- Built on large-scale models like GPT, DALL·E, Codex
- Trained on massive datasets using transformer architectures

### Foundation Models
- Large, general-purpose models fine-tuned for tasks
- Examples: **GPT-4**, **Claude**, **LLaMA**, **Gemini**
- Used for customer service, code, writing, art, etc.

### rompt Engineering
- Crafting effective prompts improves output
- Clear context + structure = better results
- Sample format: `“Write a [tone] [type] about [topic] for [audience].”`

## What I Practiced

- ✅ Rewriting vague prompts into structured, clear prompts
- ✅ Practicing few-shot and zero-shot prompt formats
- ✅ Reflecting on ethical use (Responsible AI)

## Key Takeaway

> AI isn’t magic — it’s a conversation. The better I ask, the better it responds.
